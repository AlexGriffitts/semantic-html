# Semantic-HTML-Refactoring

## Description

  The Point of this project is to take existing code that includes a large amount of non-semantic tags and convert them into semantic tags.  This makes it easier for the search engine to prioritize code and read it as what it should be.  I also added alternate text for images in the scenario that they don't show on screen.
